Programming Project Phase 2: Implement RDT 1.0 over a reliable UDP channel

Was done as a group

Group members:
Chad Abboud
Brendan Pham
Romeo Tim-Louangphixai

OS used:
Windows 10 & 11

Language:
Python 3.12.1

Files submitted:
udp_client_mod.py
udp_server_mod.py

Instructions:

UDP Client:

Run the UDP client file.
When prompted, enter the path of the BMP file you wish to send.
The client will break down the file into fixed-size packets and send them to the server sequentially over UDP.
Once all packets are sent, the client will signal the end of the transmission by sending an "end of file" marker.
The client will then close the connection.

UDP Server:

Run the UDP server file.
When prompted, enter the directory path where you want to store the received BMP file.
The server will listen for incoming packets from the client.
Upon receiving packets, the server will write them to a BMP file in the specified directory.
Once the "end of file" marker is received, indicating the end of the transmission, the server will close the connection and display a success message.

Note:

Ensure that both the client and server files are running and have access to each other over the network.
Make sure to provide correct file paths and directory paths as input when prompted.
Depending on your network configuration, you may need to adjust firewall settings to allow communication between the client and server.
